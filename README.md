# 2D Ball Animation in JavaScript

This project shows how to animate a ball using plain JavaScript without the use of any library.

The ball is just a plain DOM object. A ball shape is given by making sure the width and height is same of a div element
with a border-radius of 50%. The ball is animated over time by changing its position repeatedly by calling the
setInterval method.

## Installation

Requires no installation. You can simply download the repository and run each index.html file under the sub-folders
directly in your browser.

## Examples

Currently, there is one example which generates 1000 random balls.

![Generating 1000 Random Balls](./images/mit-2d-ball-anim-1000-balls.gif)

## Usage

To run the generate-random-balls example, drag the index.html file to your browser window. It should start running
immediately. To run it again, just refresh your browser.

## Support

Feel free to get in touch with me on either Twitter or Email for any issue running the code.

You can also watch a walk-through of the code here if you wish to use it in your own projects.

## Roadmap

There are many interesting examples that can be created with a basic 2D ball animation.

For example:

- organic movement of the ball mimicking live organism
- abstract painting generation by tracing the ball movement

In the future, the plan is to release more examples.

## License

The project is released under the MIT license. The original project is part of an assignment for the MIT xPRO Web
Development with JavaScript course.
